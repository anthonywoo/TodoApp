<!-- REV: nice job pulling these into partials.
remember the shortcut: if your variable passed will
be named the same as your partial title, you can just pass: :partial => "item_detail", :object => item_detail -->
<% @items.each do |item_detail| %>
  <%= render :partial => "item_detail", :locals => {:item_detail=> item_detail}%>

<% end %>
